# OpenSSRF Test Utilities
OpenSSRF is an open source reference implementation of the Standard Spectrum Resource 
Format (SSRF).

This library includes two utility classes:

**SSRFTestUtility**

A comprehensive test utility that fully automates execution of the following four certification tests

  * Minimum positive fill test
  * Maximum positive fill test
  * Minimum negative fill test
  * Maximum negative fill test
  
See the certification requirements, test plan and final report for details about these various tests.

**XmlLint**

A utility class to wrap the Unix <code>xmllint</code> command in a Java process and make that program accessible for XML document testing and schema validation.
